== Overview

The geOrchestra Gateway includes a comprehensive logging module that provides structured logging, request tracing, and access logging capabilities. These features help administrators monitor, debug, and audit the Gateway's operation.

The logging module provides:

* **Structured JSON Logging** - Machine-readable logs that are easy to parse and analyze
* **Request Tracing** - Unique identifiers for each request to track request flow
* **MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context)** - Contextual information added to every log entry
* **Access Logging** - Detailed logs of all HTTP requests with configurable levels

== Configuration

=== Enabling JSON Logging

To enable JSON-formatted logs, activate the `json-logs` Spring profile:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  profiles:
    active: json-logs
----

When the JSON profile is active, logs will be formatted as structured JSON objects instead of plain text, making them suitable for ingestion into log analysis tools like Elasticsearch, Splunk, or Graylog.

=== Configuring Access Logging

Access logging can be configured to log different URL patterns at different logging levels:

[source,yaml]
----
logging:
  accesslog:
    # URLs to log at INFO level
    info:
      - ".*\\/api\\/.*"
      - ".*\\/ws\\/.*"
    # URLs to log at DEBUG level
    debug:
      - ".*\\/admin\\/.*"
    # URLs to log at TRACE level
    trace:
      - ".*\\/debug\\/.*"
----

Each pattern is a Java regular expression that is matched against the full request URL. If a request URL matches multiple patterns, the highest level (INFO > DEBUG > TRACE) will be used.

=== Configuring MDC Properties

You can control which request attributes are included in the MDC (and thus in every log entry):

[source,yaml]
----
logging:
  mdc:
    enabled: true  # Enable/disable MDC support (default: true)
    include:
      # HTTP request MDC properties
      http:
        id: true                         # Include request ID as 'http.request.id'
        method: true                     # Include HTTP method as 'http.request.method'
        url: true                        # Include request URL as 'http.request.url'
        remote-addr: true                # Include client IP address as 'http.request.remote-addr'
        query-string: false              # Include query string as 'http.request.query-string'
        parameters: false                # Include request parameters as 'http.request.parameter.[name]'
        headers: true                    # Include selected HTTP headers as 'http.request.header.[name]'
        headers-pattern: "(?i)x-.*|correlation-.*"  # Pattern for included headers
        cookies: false                   # Include cookies as 'http.request.cookie.[name]'
      
      # User authentication MDC properties 
      user:
        id: true                         # Include user ID as 'enduser.id' (default: true)
        roles: true                      # Include user roles as 'enduser.roles' (default: false)
        org: false                       # Include user organization as 'enduser.org' (default: false)
        auth-method: true                # Include authentication method as 'enduser.auth-method' (default: false)
      
      # Application environment MDC properties
      app:
        name: true                       # Include application name as 'application.name' (default: true)
        version: true                    # Include application version as 'application.version' (default: true)
        profile: true                    # Include active profiles as 'application.profile' (default: true)
        instance-id: false               # Include instance ID as 'application.instance-id' (default: false)
----

IMPORTANT: Note that the property names in the configuration are different from the actual MDC key names. For example, `logging.mdc.include.http.id=true` corresponds to the MDC key `http.request.id`.

=== Log File Configuration

By default, logs are written to:

* Console output
* `${LOG_PATH}/georchestra-gateway.log` (general logs)
* `${LOG_PATH}/georchestra-gateway-access.log` (access logs)

You can customize the log file paths by setting the `LOG_PATH` environment variable or by configuring them in your application properties:

[source,yaml]
----
logging:
  file:
    path: /var/log/georchestra
----

== Log Format

=== Standard Logs

When using the JSON format, each log entry includes:

* `timestamp` - ISO-8601 timestamp
* `level` - Log level (INFO, WARN, ERROR, etc.)
* `logger_name` - Logger name
* `thread_name` - Thread name
* `message` - Log message
* `exception` - Stack trace (if applicable)
* `app_name` - Application name (always "georchestra-gateway")
* All MDC values - Added as top-level fields

Example JSON log entries:

*Standard Application Log*

}
----

=== Access Logs

Access logs follow the same JSON format but include specific HTTP request information:

* `http.request.method` - HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
* `http.status_code` - Response status code
* `http.request.url` - Request URL
* `http.request.remote-addr` - Client IP address
* `message` - Formatted as "METHOD STATUS_CODE URL" (e.g. "GET 200 /api/users")

== Request Tracing

Each incoming request is assigned a unique ID, which is:

1. Extracted from the `trace-id`, `http.request.id`, or `X-Request-ID` headers if present
2. Generated as a new ULID (Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier) if not present

This ID is:

* Added to the MDC as `http.request.id`
* Included in all log entries related to the request
* Added to the response as the `X-Request-ID` header

This allows tracking a request through all components of the system.

== Extending Logging Capabilities

=== Adding Custom MDC Values

You can add custom values to the MDC by implementing a `WebFilter` that runs after the MDC filter:

[source,java]
----
@Component
@Order(Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE + 1)
public class CustomMdcFilter implements WebFilter {
    @Override
    public Mono<Void> filter(ServerWebExchange exchange, WebFilterChain chain) {
        // Add custom MDC values
        MDC.put("custom.value", "someValue");
        
        // Continue the chain
        return chain.filter(exchange);
    }
}
----

=== Accessing MDC in Reactive Code

The `ReactorContextHolder` utility class provides several methods for working with MDC in reactive code:

[source,java]
----
// Get MDC from the current thread's context
Map<String, String> mdcMap = ReactorContextHolder.getMdcMap();

// Set thread-local MDC from a map
ReactorContextHolder.setThreadLocalMdc(customMdcMap);

// Set thread-local MDC from a Reactor Context
ReactorContextHolder.setMdcFromContext(context);

// Get MDC map from a Mono's context (non-blocking)
Mono<Map<String, String>> mdcMono = ReactorContextHolder.getMdcMapFromContext(mono);

// Extract MDC map from a context view (non-blocking)
Map<String, String> mdcMap = ReactorContextHolder.extractMdcMapFromContext(context);
----

Example for using MDC in custom reactive components:

[source,java]
----
@Component
public class CustomReactiveComponent {
    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(CustomReactiveComponent.class);
    
    public Mono<String> processRequest(String input) {
        return Mono.deferContextual(ctx -> {
            // Extract MDC from the reactor context
            Map<String, String> mdcMap = ReactorContextHolder.extractMdcMapFromContext(ctx);
            
            // Log with MDC context
            String requestId = mdcMap.getOrDefault("http.request.id", "unknown");
            log.info("Processing request {} with input: {}", requestId, input);
            
            // Process the request
            return Mono.just("Processed: " + input);
        });
    }
}
----

=== Using the Request ID in Client Applications

Client applications can include their own request ID using the `X-Request-ID` header, which will be honored by the Gateway and propagated through all logs.

== Log Management Recommendations

=== Log Rotation

The built-in configuration automatically rotates logs:

* When they reach 50MB size
* Daily
* Keeping up to 7 days of history
* With a total cap of 1GB per log type

You can override these settings by providing your own `logback.xml` configuration file.

=== Log Aggregation

For production environments, we recommend:

1. Configure JSON-formatted logs
2. Use a log aggregation tool like Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK stack)
3. Create dashboards for monitoring:
   * Error rates
   * Response times
   * Request volumes by endpoint
   * Authentication failures

=== Security Considerations

The logging module automatically masks sensitive information:

* Authorization headers are not logged
* Password parameters are not logged
* Cookie values can be disabled via configuration

Be careful when enabling additional headers or parameters in the MDC configuration to avoid logging sensitive information.

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

==== Missing MDC Values in Logs

If MDC values are not appearing in your logs:

1. Verify that the `logging.mdc.enabled` property is set to true
2. Check that the specific MDC properties you expect are enabled (e.g., `logging.mdc.include.http.id=true` for request ID)
3. Ensure the logback configuration includes MDC values (`<includeMdc>true</includeMdc>` in the LogstashEncoder)
4. For reactive applications, check that MDC propagation is working through the reactive chain

==== MDC Propagation Issues in Reactive Code

Since WebFlux applications use a reactive programming model where requests can span multiple threads, standard thread-local MDC doesn't work properly. The logging module handles this by propagating MDC through the Reactor Context.

If you're experiencing MDC propagation issues:

1. Ensure you're not using blocking methods in reactive code
2. Use the `ReactorContextHolder` utility methods to access MDC from reactive chains
3. For custom reactive components, use `Mono.deferContextual()` to capture the context

Example for custom reactive code:
[source,java]
----
return Mono.deferContextual(ctx -> {
    // Use extractMdcMapFromContext method to get MDC from context
    Map<String, String> mdcMap = ReactorContextHolder.extractMdcMapFromContext(ctx);
    log.info("Processing with request ID: {}", mdcMap.get("http.request.id"));
    return Mono.just(result);
});
----

==== JSON Logging Not Working

If logs are not in JSON format:

1. Verify the `json-logs` profile is active
2. Check that you don't have a custom `logback.xml` that overrides the default configuration
3. Make sure the LogstashEncoder dependency is correctly included in your classpath

==== Access Logs Not Appearing

If access logs are missing:

1. Check that your URL patterns match the requests you expect to log
2. Verify the log level for your patterns matches the log level enabled in your application
3. Ensure the `logging.accesslog.enabled` property is set to `true`

=== Debug Mode

To enable debug logging for the logging module itself:

[source,yaml]
----
logging:
  level:
    org.georchestra.gateway.logging: DEBUG
----

This will produce more detailed logs about the logging process itself, which can help diagnose issues.
