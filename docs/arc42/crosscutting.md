# Crosscutting Concerns

This document describes the crosscutting concerns addressed by the geOrchestra Gateway architecture, which span multiple components and layers of the system.

## Overview

Crosscutting concerns are aspects of a system that affect multiple components and cannot be cleanly decomposed into a single module or layer. In the geOrchestra Gateway, several important crosscutting concerns have been identified and addressed through architectural patterns and design decisions.

## Security

Security is a primary crosscutting concern that affects every part of the Gateway.

### Authentication

Authentication is implemented through several mechanisms:

- **LDAP Authentication**: For username/password authentication against an LDAP directory.
- **OAuth2/OpenID Connect**: For delegated authentication using external identity providers.
- **Header Pre-authentication**: For integration with upstream authentication proxies.

Key classes involved:

- `GatewaySecurityConfiguration`: Central configuration for all security components.
- `LdapAuthenticationConfiguration`: LDAP-specific authentication.
- `OAuth2Configuration`: OAuth2/OpenID Connect authentication.
- `HeaderPreAuthenticationConfiguration`: Header-based pre-authentication.

### Authorization

Authorization is enforced at multiple levels:

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Rules defined in the configuration determine which roles can access which paths.
- **Spring Security Integration**: Leverages Spring Security's authorization framework.
- **GeorchestraUserRolesAuthorizationManager**: Custom authorization manager that enforces access rules.

### Secure Communication

The Gateway ensures secure communication:

- **TLS Termination**: Typically handled at the load balancer or Gateway level.
- **Secure Headers**: Added to responses to enforce browser security policies.
- **Header Sanitization**: Removes potentially dangerous headers from incoming requests.

### User Information Management

User information is standardized and made available:

- `GeorchestraUser` model encapsulates all user information.
- User details are propagated to backend services via HTTP headers.
- Role mappings allow dynamic extension of user roles.

## Logging and Monitoring

Logging and monitoring are essential for observability and troubleshooting.

### Structured Logging

The Gateway implements structured logging:

- **JSON Log Format**: Enables machine-readable logs in production.
- **Configurable Log Levels**: Different components can have different log verbosity.
- **MDC Propagation**: Context information is preserved across asynchronous boundaries.

Key components:

- `ReactorContextHolder`: Ensures MDC context is maintained in reactive code.
- `AccessLogFilter`: Records HTTP requests with pattern-based filtering.
- `MdcLogEnhancerFilter`: Adds context information to logs.

### Metrics Collection

Application metrics are collected and exposed:

- Spring Boot Actuator provides metrics endpoints.
- Custom metrics can be added for domain-specific measurements.
- Health checks provide system status information.

### Correlation IDs

Request tracing is supported through correlation IDs:

- Each request receives a unique identifier.
- The ID is propagated through the filter chain.
- The ID is included in logs for easier troubleshooting.

## Configuration Management

Configuration management is another important crosscutting concern.

### Externalized Configuration

Configuration is externalized from the application:

- **Data Directory**: External directory for configuration files.
- **YAML Files**: Configuration is primarily in YAML format.
- **Environment Variables**: Override capability via environment variables.

### Configuration Validation

Configuration is validated to ensure correctness:

- **Spring Validation**: Bean validation for configuration properties.
- **Custom Validators**: Domain-specific validation rules.
- **Fail-Fast Approach**: Application fails to start with invalid configuration.

### Feature Toggles

Features can be enabled or disabled:

- **Spring Profiles**: Activate specific functionality.
- **Conditional Beans**: Components are conditionally created based on configuration.
- **Feature Flags**: Configuration properties that enable/disable features.

## Internationalization (i18n)

The Gateway supports internationalization:

- **Message Bundles**: Localized messages for UI elements.
- **Language Selection**: Based on browser preferences.
- **UTF-8 Support**: Throughout the application.

Key files:

- `messages/login_*.properties`: Localized messages for the login page.

## Error Handling

Error handling is standardized across the application:

- **Global Error Handlers**: Catch and process errors consistently.
- **Friendly Error Pages**: Custom error pages for different HTTP status codes.
- **Error Attributes**: Standardized error response format.

Key components:

- `CustomErrorAttributes`: Enhances error information for responses.
- `ApplicationErrorGatewayFilterFactory`: Handles errors in the Gateway filter chain.

## Reactive Programming

As a reactive application, several patterns are applied:

- **Non-Blocking Operations**: All I/O operations are non-blocking.
- **Backpressure Handling**: Controls the flow of data through the system.
- **Reactive Context Propagation**: Carries contextual information across threads.

## Dependency Injection

Spring's dependency injection is used throughout:

- **Constructor Injection**: Primary method for dependencies.
- **Configuration Classes**: Define beans and their relationships.
- **Component Scanning**: Automatic discovery of components.

## Event-Driven Architecture

For loose coupling between components:

- **Event Publishers**: Components that emit events.
- **Event Listeners**: Components that react to events.
- **RabbitMQ Integration**: For cross-service communication.

Key components:

- `RabbitmqEventsConfiguration`: Configures event publishing via RabbitMQ.
- `RabbitmqAccountCreatedEventSender`: Sends account creation events.
- `RabbitmqEventsListener`: Listens for events from other services.

## Testing Utilities

Testing support is provided across layers:

- **Integration Test Base Classes**: Common setup for integration tests.
- **Test Fixtures**: Reusable test data and configurations.
- **Mock Services**: Simplify testing of individual components.

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

CORS is handled globally:

- **Configurable CORS Rules**: Define allowed origins, methods, and headers.
- **Spring CORS Support**: Leverages Spring's CORS handling.
- **Pre-flight Handling**: Correctly responds to OPTIONS requests.

## Implementation

These crosscutting concerns are implemented through a combination of:

1. **Aspect-Oriented Programming**: For concerns that can be modularized.
2. **Decorators and Wrappers**: For enhancing existing functionality.
3. **Middleware Patterns**: Filters and interceptors in the request processing pipeline.
4. **Common Base Classes**: For shared functionality across components.
5. **Service Abstractions**: For consistent access to common services.

## Best Practices

To maintain clean handling of crosscutting concerns:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component should handle one primary concern.
2. **Consistent Patterns**: Use the same patterns for similar concerns.
3. **Configuration Over Code**: Prefer configuration for crosscutting behavior.
4. **Interface-Based Design**: Define clear interfaces for crosscutting services.
5. **Documentation**: Document how crosscutting concerns are addressed.
