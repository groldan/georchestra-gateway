# Architecture Goals

This document outlines the primary architectural goals of the geOrchestra Gateway, which guide its design, implementation, and evolution.

## Primary Goals

### 1. Security

**Goal**: Provide a secure, centralized authentication and authorization layer for the entire geOrchestra platform.

**Rationale**: As the entry point for all user interactions, the Gateway must enforce robust security controls to protect sensitive geospatial data and services.

**Approaches**:

- Implement multiple authentication methods (LDAP, OAuth2/OpenID Connect, Header pre-authentication)
- Enforce role-based access control for all services
- Apply security best practices (HTTPS, secure headers, CSRF protection)
- Sanitize and validate all user input and headers
- Support password policy enforcement through LDAP

### 2. Flexibility and Extensibility

**Goal**: Create a highly configurable and extensible platform that can adapt to different deployment scenarios and requirements.

**Rationale**: geOrchestra installations vary widely in their specific requirements, integration needs, and deployment environments.

**Approaches**:

- Modular architecture with clear extension points
- External configuration through the data directory
- Service-based design with well-defined interfaces
- Support for plugin development through Spring's extension mechanisms
- Customizable authentication and user mapping

### 3. Modern Reactive Architecture

**Goal**: Utilize a reactive programming model to ensure high throughput and efficient resource utilization.

**Rationale**: Gateway performance directly impacts the user experience of the entire platform, and reactive programming provides better scalability under high load.

**Approaches**:

- Built on Spring WebFlux and Project Reactor
- Non-blocking I/O throughout the application
- Reactive data access where possible
- Asynchronous event handling via RabbitMQ

### 4. Observability

**Goal**: Provide comprehensive monitoring, logging, and troubleshooting capabilities.

**Rationale**: Operational visibility is critical for maintaining a reliable production service and quickly identifying issues.

**Approaches**:

- Structured JSON logging with configurable detail levels
- MDC propagation in reactive contexts
- Spring Boot Actuator endpoints for monitoring
- Correlation IDs across service boundaries
- Access logging with pattern-based filtering

### 5. Developer Experience

**Goal**: Create a codebase that is easy to understand, extend, and maintain.

**Rationale**: An approachable codebase encourages community contributions and ensures long-term sustainability.

**Approaches**:

- Clear package structure and separation of concerns
- Comprehensive documentation
- Consistent coding standards
- Extensive test coverage
- Simplified local development setup

## Secondary Goals

### 1. Backward Compatibility

**Goal**: Maintain compatibility with existing geOrchestra services and deployment patterns.

**Rationale**: Organizations upgrading from the previous security-proxy should be able to do so with minimal disruption.

**Approaches**:

- Compatible header schemes for service communication
- Similar configuration structure where appropriate
- Support for legacy authentication patterns

### 2. Performance

**Goal**: Minimize latency and resource utilization.

**Rationale**: The Gateway is in the critical path for all user requests, making its performance impact multiplicative.

**Approaches**:

- Efficient proxy implementation using Spring Cloud Gateway
- Caching of authentication and authorization decisions where appropriate
- Connection pooling for backend services
- Optimized filter chain processing

### 3. Interoperability

**Goal**: Support integration with external systems and identity providers.

**Rationale**: Many organizations need to integrate geOrchestra with existing identity management systems.

**Approaches**:

- Support for standard protocols (OAuth2, OpenID Connect, LDAP)
- Flexible header-based pre-authentication for proxy integration
- Event-driven architecture for system integration

### 4. Cloud-Native Design

**Goal**: Ensure the Gateway works well in containerized and orchestrated environments.

**Rationale**: Modern deployments increasingly use containers and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

**Approaches**:

- Stateless design where possible
- Externalized configuration
- Health checks and readiness probes
- Graceful startup and shutdown
- Support for horizontal scaling
