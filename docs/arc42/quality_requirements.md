# Quality Requirements

This document specifies the quality requirements for the geOrchestra Gateway, focusing on the key quality attributes that drive the architecture and implementation decisions.

## Quality Attributes Overview

The geOrchestra Gateway prioritizes the following quality attributes:

1. **Security**: Protection of sensitive data and systems
2. **Reliability**: Consistent performance under various conditions
3. **Performance**: Response time and throughput
4. **Maintainability**: Ease of making changes and extensions
5. **Scalability**: Ability to handle increased load
6. **Interoperability**: Integration with other systems
7. **Usability**: User experience for administrators and end users
8. **Testability**: Ease of verifying behavior

## Security Requirements

### Authentication Strength

**Requirement**: The Gateway must support multiple authentication methods with industry-standard security.

**Scenarios**:

- **Scenario 1**: An attacker attempts to bypass authentication by manipulating HTTP headers. The system must detect and reject such attempts.

- **Scenario 2**: A brute force attack against the login page is initiated. The system must implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms.

**Measures**:

- Support for OAuth2/OpenID Connect with current security practices
- LDAP authentication with secure password handling
- Header pre-authentication with verification

### Authorization Control

**Requirement**: The Gateway must enforce fine-grained access control based on user roles and request patterns.

**Scenarios**:

- **Scenario 1**: A user attempts to access a protected resource without appropriate permissions. The access must be denied with a 403 status code.

- **Scenario 2**: An authenticated user with appropriate roles requests access to a permitted resource. The access must be granted.

**Measures**:

- Role-based access control with pattern matching
- Configurable access rules for different routes
- Default-deny security posture

### Data Protection

**Requirement**: The Gateway must protect sensitive data in transit and ensure secure communication.

**Scenarios**:

- **Scenario 1**: An external eavesdropper attempts to intercept communication between the client and Gateway. All sensitive data must be encrypted.

- **Scenario 2**: A backend service attempts to access user credentials. The Gateway must not forward raw credentials.

**Measures**:

- TLS for all external communication
- Secure headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- Credential isolation and protection

## Reliability Requirements

### Availability

**Requirement**: The Gateway must maintain high availability as the central entry point to the platform.

**Scenarios**:

- **Scenario 1**: One Gateway instance fails in a multi-instance deployment. The system continues to function with minimal user impact.

- **Scenario 2**: A downstream service becomes unavailable. The Gateway properly handles and reports the failure without becoming unavailable itself.

**Measures**:

- 99.9% uptime target
- Support for horizontal scaling
- Circuit breaker patterns for dependency failures

### Fault Tolerance

**Requirement**: The Gateway must handle errors gracefully and continue functioning despite partial system failures.

**Scenarios**:

- **Scenario 1**: The LDAP server becomes temporarily unavailable. The Gateway should retry connections and provide clear error messages.

- **Scenario 2**: An invalid configuration is deployed. The Gateway should fail fast with clear error messages rather than behave unpredictably.

**Measures**:

- Graceful degradation when dependencies fail
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed logging of error conditions
- Automatic recovery mechanisms

### Data Consistency

**Requirement**: The Gateway must maintain consistent state during authentication and session management.

**Scenarios**:

- **Scenario 1**: A user is authenticated while the system is under heavy load. The authentication state must be consistently maintained.

- **Scenario 2**: Session data is modified concurrently. The system must prevent data corruption or inconsistency.

**Measures**:

- Atomic operations for critical state changes
- Proper synchronization in session management
- Idempotent API operations where appropriate

## Performance Requirements

### Response Time

**Requirement**: The Gateway must add minimal latency to request processing.

**Scenarios**:

- **Scenario 2**: For authentication operations, 95% of requests should complete within 500ms.

**Measures**:

- Latency monitoring at percentiles (50th, 95th, 99th)
- Performance testing as part of CI/CD
- Optimization of critical request paths

### Throughput

**Requirement**: The Gateway must handle the expected traffic volume with headroom for growth.

**Scenarios**:

- **Scenario 1**: The system must support at least 100 requests per second per instance under normal conditions.

- **Scenario 2**: During peak loads, the system should maintain acceptable performance up to 200 requests per second per instance.

**Measures**:

- Load testing as part of release process
- Monitoring of request rates and response times
- Capacity planning based on observed patterns

### Resource Utilization

**Requirement**: The Gateway must use resources efficiently.

**Scenarios**:

- **Scenario 1**: Under normal load, CPU utilization should remain below 60%.

- **Scenario 2**: Memory consumption should be stable over time without significant leaks.

**Measures**:

- Maximum 1GB heap size per instance under normal load
- CPU usage monitoring
- Memory leak detection

## Maintainability Requirements

### Modularity

**Requirement**: The Gateway code should be modular to allow isolated changes and extensions.

**Scenarios**:

- **Scenario 1**: A developer needs to add a new authentication provider. This should be possible without modifying existing authentication code.

**Measures**:

- Clear component boundaries
- Dependency injection for loose coupling
- Interface-based design for extensibility

### Code Quality

**Requirement**: The codebase should follow best practices for readability and maintainability.

**Scenarios**:

- **Scenario 1**: A new developer joins the project and needs to understand the authentication flow. This should be clear from the code structure and documentation.

- **Scenario 2**: A bug is reported in a specific component. A developer should be able to isolate and fix the issue without affecting other components.

**Measures**:

- Static code analysis in CI pipeline
- Coding standards enforcement
